# zfp-sys
Raw Rust bindings to ZFP (https://github.com/LLNL/zfp).

The build supports compiling either zfp-0.5.4 or zfp-0.5.5. There are significant design and speed differences between these two versions.
In particular the default cache size has changed (see https://github.com/LLNL/zfp/issues/88).
